# Pizze d'alieni - An Alien pizza place serving imaginary pizzas

This project is a portfolio project meant to be a means for me to get
familiar with databases, and to highlight key full stack abilities of
mine.

## Scope of project

On this website, you are able to do the following things

- View a list of pizzas served at this alien establishment, queried
  from a database
- View opening and closing times with dynamically updated status box
  showing if they are currently open or closed.
- Put pizzas in a virtual cart for you to checkout with
  your inbox pretending to be an order confirmation
- Make an account so you don't have to type in email every time.
- If logged in with account, view order history
- Ability to delete account and associated data (for GDPR reasons)

## Future plans for this project
- Card info is also stored with accounts
- Pay an actual real life cent for a real life email to be sent in
- Password reset option in case password is forgotten
- Change settings in your account such as profile name, preferred
  email, and card info
